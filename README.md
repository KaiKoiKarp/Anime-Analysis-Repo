Problem Definition
Are we able to predict the rating of an anime based on it’s factors?

Models Used
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Neural Networks

Conclusion
Decision Tree Classification is relatively inaccurate, they are deterministic in the sense that there is no randomness to split the data, and they tend to overfit.

Learning Outcome
