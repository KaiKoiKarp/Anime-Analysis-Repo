## Problem Definition

Are we able to predict the rating of an anime based on itâ€™s factors?

## Models Used

1) Decision Tree
2) Random Forest
3) Neural Networks

## Conclusion

Decision Tree Classification is relatively inaccurate, they are deterministic in the sense that there is no randomness to split the data, and they tend to overfit.

## Learning Outcome

todo
